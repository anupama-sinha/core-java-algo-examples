## Tree

### Binary Tree Types
* Full Binary Tree : Every node has 0/2 children
* Complete Binary Tree : All nodes have either 2 children nodes or last level has atleast left node
* Perfect Binary Tree : All internal nodes with 2 children & leaf nodes at same level
> Number of Leaf Nodes = No of Internal Nodes + 1
> Number of Nodes = 2^h-1
* Balanced Binary Tree : Height from -1 to 1 difference
> Height = O(log n)
* Degenerate or Pathological Tree or Skewed Tree

## Binary Tree Features
* Max number of nodes at Level l = 2^l
* Max number of nodes = 2^(h+1)-1
